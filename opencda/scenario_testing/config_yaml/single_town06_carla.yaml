  Content: This is the scenario testing configuration file for single vehicle testing in town06 with perception/localization activated

# First define the basic parameters of the vehicles
vehicle_base:
  sensing:
    perception:
      activate: false # when not activated, objects positions will be retrieved from server directly
      camera:
        visualize: 0 # how many camera images need to be visualized. 0 means no visualization for camera
        num: 0 # how many cameras are mounted on the vehicle. Maximum 3(frontal, left and right cameras)
        # relative positions (x,y,z,yaw) of the camera. len(positions) should be equal to camera num
        # positions:
        #   - [2.5, 0, 1.0, 0]
        #   - [0.0, 0.3, 1.8, 100]

        #   - [-2.0, 0.0, 1.5, 180]
  behavior:
    max_speed: 55 #55 # maximum speed, km/h

    collision_time_ahead: 2.0 # used for collision checking
    local_planner:  # trajectory planning related
      buffer_size: 12 # waypoint buffer size


# define the background traffic control by carla
# carla_traffic_manager:
#   random: true # whether to random select vehicles' color and model
#   vehicle_list: ~  # a number or a list
#   # Used only when vehicle_list is a number.
