OpenCDA is an open co-simulation-based **research/engineering framework** integrated with prototype cooperative driving automation (CDA; see [SAE J3216](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3216_202005/)) pipelines as well as regular automated driving components (e.g., perception, localization, planning, control).  It not only enables CDA evaluation in a CARLA + SUMO co-simulation environment but also provides a rich library of source codes of CDA research pipelines. 

In collaboration with  [U.S.DOT CDA Research](https://its.dot.gov/cda/) and the [FHWA CARMA Program](https://highways.dot.gov/research/operations/CARMA), OpenCDA, as an open-source project, is designed and built to support <strong>early-stage fundamental research </strong>  for CDA research and development. Through collaboration with CARMA Collaborative, this tool provides a unique capability to the CDA research community and will interface with the [CARMA XiL tools](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-simulation) being developed by U.S.DOT to support more advanced simulation testing of CDA Features.


The key features of OpenCDA are:
* <strong> Research Pipeline </strong>: OpenCDA provides rich research pipelines (i.e., open-source codes for basic and advanced CDA modules, such as platooning, cooperative perception).
* <strong>Integration</strong>: OpenCDA utilizes CARLA and SUMO separately, as well as integrates them together.
* <strong> Full-stack Simulation</strong>: OpenCDA provides a simple prototype automated driving and cooperative driving platform, <strong>all in Python</strong>, that contains perception, localization, planning, control, and V2X communication modules.
* <strong>Modularity</strong>: OpenCDA is highly modularized. 
* <strong>Benchmark</strong>: OpenCDA offers benchmark testing scenarios, benchmark baseline maps, state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms, and benchmark evaluation metrics.
* <strong>Connectivity and Cooperation</strong>: OpenCDA supports various levels and categories of cooperation between CAVs in simulation. This differentiates OpenCDA from other single vehicle simulation tools.


Users could refer to [OpenCDA documentation](https://opencda-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details.

## What's New
### July 2022
* Powered by OpenCDA, our paper [V2X-ViT: Vehicle-to-Everything Cooperative
Perception with Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10638.pdf) has been accepted by **ECCV2022**! Check the codebase [v2x-vit](https://github.com/DerrickXuNu/v2x-vit) if interested.
### March 2022
* HD Map manager is online! It currently supports generating rasterization map that includes road topology, traffic light info, and dynamic objects around each cav in real-time. This can be
used for RL planning, HD Map learning, scene understanding, etc.

### Feb 2022
* Our paper [*OPV2V: An Open Benchmark Dataset and Fusion Pipeline for Perception with Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07644)
  has been accepted by ICRA 2022! It utilizes  the offline Cooperative Perception(data dumping) function in OpenCDA. Check the benchmark codebase [OpenCOOD](https://github.com/DerrickXuNu/OpenCOOD) of OPV2V if interested.
### Oct 2021
 * CARLA 0.9.12 now supported; Different weather conditions are supported.
 * Better traffic management supported: users now can set a customized range to background cars.


## Major Components
![teaser](docs/md_files/images/OpenCDA_new_diagrams.png)

OpenCDA  consists of four major component: <strong>Cooperative Driving System</strong>,  <strong>Co-Simulation Tools</strong>, <strong>Data Manager and Repository</strong>,
and  <strong>Scenario Manager</strong>.
